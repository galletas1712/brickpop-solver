# Brickpop Solver

To run the executable, open Terminal, and do the following:
```
chmod +x solve
./solve < data3.txt
```
You can swap data3.txt for data4.txt. These are sample board with 3 and 4 colors respectively. The program will output the score achievable and the coordinates from the top left corner for the user to press in order to achieve the optimal solution.

Note that there is a bug that somehow the program doesn't necessarily print winning moves.
